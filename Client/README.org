#+TITLE: Elm Clients

Elm client that is served to web browsers. Different files can be used for different full page applications, such as the public facing user interface as well as private admin dashboards.

* Developing
To develop, determine whether you are developing a component, the main page, or the webmaster dashboard. Then, run the respective commands:

- For components: ~docker-compose up -d reactor_proxy~, then go to [[http://localhost:3001][http://localhost:3001]]
- For the main page: ~docker-compose up -d client_proxy~, then go to [[http://localhost][http://localhost]]
- For the webmaster dashboard: ~docker-compose up -d dashboard_proxy~, then go to [[http://localhost:3000][http://localhost:3000]]

These services run on different ports, and are not mutually exclusive.

Open a browser and go to [[http://localhost][localhost]], and then browse to src/Main.elm to run Main.elm. Different pages may have sandboxes set up to provide demonstrations and tests of their APIs.
